Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
*/
		let a = [2, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6]
		let b = [2, 4]
		console.log(a, b)

		function arrayDiff(a, b) {
			b.forEach((val, index, arr) => {
				for (i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
					if (val === a[i])
						a.splice(i, 1)
				}
			});
		}
